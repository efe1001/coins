                        <p class="coinf11">Bitcoin prices will surge if escalating tensions in the Middle East cause oil and energy prices to rise, according to Arthur Hayes, co-founder of the crypto exchange BitMEX. 

                            Hayes wrote in an Oct. 16 blog post that “oil prices would spike” in a scenario in which major oil and natural gas fields were attacked in an escalated conflict between Iran and Israel. He said that
                             would “drag all other energy prices higher as nations 
                             short on oil would use other energy substitutes to power their economies.”
                             Hayes said that mining profitability would adjust through difficulty changes, however, if the hashrate drops, the mining difficulty will also, “which makes it easier for new entrants to mine Bitcoin at higher energy prices profitably.”
                            <br><br>
                             Hayes provided a historical example of large gains in commodities from 1973 to 1982 during the oil crises caused by the Arab oil embargo and the Iranian revolution. Oil prices rose 412% and gold rose 380%, nearly matching oil's increase. 
                             <br><br>
                             While Bitcoin 
                             BTC
                             tickers down
                             $67,919
                              didn’t exist during these oil crises, it has shown some correlation with commodities during inflationary periods.
                            <br><br>
                              Should Middle Eastern oil be removed from the market “the Bitcoin blockchain will continue to function, and the price will, at minimum, hold its value vs. energy and definitely rise in fiat currency terms,” he said. 
                            <br><br>
                              Oil prices have fallen this week with West Texas Intermediary dropping by around 3.7% since Monday to $71.09 per barrel on Oct. 17, according to Oilprice.com. 
                              <br><br>
                              Meanwhile, Bitcoin gained more than 8% over the week, topping $68,000 for the first time since late July in early trading on Oct. 18. </p>
