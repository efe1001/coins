                            Goatseus Maximus, a new Pump.fun meme coin surged by over 50% after being listed by several exchanges and as its volume jumped.

                            The Goatseus Maximus (GOAT) rose to a record high of $0.6794, much higher than last week’s low of $0.045. Its market cap has jumped from about $48 million in this period to $668 million to $668 million. 
                            
                            This surge was driven by three main factors. First, its futures contract was added by Bybit, one of the biggest crypto exchanges in the industry. The listing gives users the ability to trade with up to 12.5x leverage. 
                            GOAT will also listed by Woo, another popular exchange. Other exchanges that have listed it in the spot market are BitMEX, Bitget, Gate.io, HTX, and Crypto.com. According to CoinGecko, most of its volume was in Orca, the second-biggest DEX in the Solana Solana
                            sol
                            4.24%
                            Solana ecosystem

                            Cryptocurrencies often rally after being listed by some of these tier-1 exchanges because it is often seen as a sign of validation. A listing also helps to expose the token to millions of more crypto investors. This explains why its daily volume jumped to over $384 million on Tuesday.
                            The GOAT token has also soared because of increased whale activity. For example, according to Lookonchain, one trader withdraw Solana tokens worth $5.4 million and invested $3.39 million in GOAT. Another trader withdrew Solana tokens worth $2.4 million from Binance and bought GOAT.
                            
                            In most cases, such big purchases and token surges lead to the fear of missing out among traders, pushing a token higher. 

GOAT’s surge has now made it the biggest token in the Pump.fun ecosystem. It has also helped to push the total market cap in the ecosystem to over $2.1 billion. The other notable tokens in the ecosystem are Fwog, Michi, and Moo Deng.</p>
