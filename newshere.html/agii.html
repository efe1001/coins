                            Long-time OpenAI safety researcher Miles Brundage will start or join another artificial intelligence firm after quitting his position as head of “AGI Readiness” and leaving the company on Oct. 23. 

                            Brundage, who joined OpenAI in 2018 as a researcher, was positioned as the company’s top safety officer.
                            
                            In a Substack post discussing his departure he claimed that OpenAI’s “AGI Readiness” team will be disbanded, potentially leaving the firm without a dedicated safety department.
                            
                            AGI, or artificial general intelligence, is a theoretical paradigm wherein an AI model would be capable of performing any task a human could do if given the same resources.
                            
                            Brundage’s team’s primary purpose appeared to have been providing policy suggestions and safety oversight for the company’s continuing development toward AGI. 
                            
                            His exit, according to the post, was prompted by the desire to focus on independent research and advocacy. He cited several reasons for his departure including the desire to “be less biased” toward his corporate setting, and to seek opportunities through either entrepreneurship or at a different organization. 
                            
                            Per Brundage: 
                            
                            “I plan to start a new nonprofit (and/or join an existing nonprofit) and will work on AI policy research and advocacy. I will probably do some mix of research and advocacy but the details and ratios are TBD.”
                            The researcher might not be out of a job for long, however, as he’s already made a potential business connection with Brendan McCord, founder and Chief of Cosmos Institute, an organization dedicated to developing technology with a humanist approach.  </div>
