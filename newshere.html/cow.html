                            Ethereum network, has risen by over 18,000% from its lowest point in June. This rally has made it one of the best-performing cryptocurrencies, with its market cap soaring to over $109 million.
                            
                            Hoppy’s surge is being fueled by a growing number of holders. Data from CoinCarp shows that it now has over 3,600 users, with the top ten holders accounting for 42% of the total. Its daily volume hit a record high of $14.7 million this week.
                            
                            The number of holders could likely increase if the token were listed on tier-1 exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, and OKX. Additional data from CoinGecko shows that most of its trading was happening in Uniswap (UNI), the biggest player in the decentralized exchange industry. The top CEX exchanges that have listed Hoppy are MEXC, Bitmart, and BingX. 
                            Hoppy’s rally coincides with gains in other Solana and Ethereum-based meme coins. Data from CoinMarketCap shows that tokens like Cat in a dogs world, Book of Meme, Mog Coin, Brett, and Dogecoin were some of the best-performing cryptocurrencies in the past week. The total market cap of meme coins has jumped to $61 billion.
